Based on the provided output and the problem statement, here's how we can proceed:

Merging the Data
To merge the data from all 20 files into a final input file, we need to concatenate the data from each file into a single dataframe. This dataframe will consist of columns for DateTime, Air Temperature, Pressure, Wind Speed, and Power Generated. We'll repeat this process for each type of data (air temperature, pressure, wind speed, power generated) and then merge them all together into one final dataframe.

Distributing Power to Consumption Nodes
Once we have the total power generated for the first 3 months of 2024, we need to distribute this power to the 3 different consumption nodes based on the specified ratios:

Node 1: 20% of total power
Node 2: 45% of total power
Node 3: 35% of total power
We'll calculate the power to be allocated to each node accordingly.

Determining Grid Stability
To determine the stability of the power grid, we'll use the existing and newly prepared dataset. This dataset includes parameters such as power generated at each node, price per unit, unit consumption, and the stability report on an hourly basis. We'll utilize machine learning models to predict the stability of the grid based on these parameters.

Analysis and Reporting
Finally, we'll analyze the output to determine the percentage of stable and unstable grid conditions over the span of three months. This analysis will provide insights into overall stability trends and identify patterns in instability occurrences throughout the day. The insights gained can inform grid operators about potential vulnerabilities and enable proactive measures to mitigate instability risks.

Conclusion
By following these steps and leveraging machine learning techniques, we can address the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources into smart grids, optimize grid performance, and contribute to the advancement of sustainable energy systems.

To address the problem statement outlined in the context of the "Smart Grid Optimization: Integrating Renewable Energy for Sustainable Power Systems" hackathon, here's an approach for the solution:

Data Preparation and Integration:
Merge Data Files: Combine the individual data files for each parameter (air temperature, pressure, wind speed, power generated) across the five years into a single comprehensive dataset. This involves concatenating the data horizontally, ensuring consistency in the datetime index.

Load Forecast Data: Import the forecasted values for the independent variables (air temperature, pressure, wind speed) for the first three months of 2024 from the provided file.

Preprocess Data: Check for and handle any missing values, ensure uniform datetime indexing, and address any inconsistencies or outliers in the data.

Power Generation Prediction:
Feature Engineering: Create additional features if needed, such as time-based features or lagged variables, to capture temporal patterns in the data.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for power generation prediction, considering factors like time-series nature, feature importance, and interpretability. Models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting or LSTM could be considered.

Model Training and Validation: Train the selected models using historical data and validate them using the provided target variables for the first three months of 2024.

Prediction: Use the trained models to predict total power generated (p) for the specified time period at an hourly granularity, based on the forecasted independent variables.

Power Distribution to Consumption Nodes:
Calculate Power Distribution: Utilize the predicted total power generated (p) and allocate it among the three consumption nodes based on the specified ratios (20%, 45%, and 35%).

Create Database: Prepare a database containing the distributed power values for each consumption node along with the timestamp.

Grid Stability Assessment:
Data Integration: Combine the power generation data with the existing smart grid dataset containing information on power generation, price per unit, power consumption, and stability reports on an hourly basis.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the integrated dataset, including power generation at each node, power consumption, and price per unit.

Model Training: Train a classification model to predict grid stability (dependent variable) based on the extracted features.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights and Reporting:
Stability Analysis: Analyze the stability trends over the three-month period, including the percentage of stable and unstable grid conditions, identifying patterns in instability occurrences, and exploring potential vulnerabilities.

Visualization: Present insights and findings using informative visualizations such as time series plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to effectively communicate the analysis results.

Documentation: Document the entire solution approach, including data preprocessing steps, model selection rationale, training methodologies, and key findings, in a clear and concise manner.

Presentation: Prepare a comprehensive report or presentation summarizing the solution approach, methodology, results, and recommendations for optimizing smart grid operations and enhancing renewable energy integration.

By following this approach, participants can effectively tackle the hackathon challenge and develop innovative solutions for smart grid optimization and sustainable energy management.
